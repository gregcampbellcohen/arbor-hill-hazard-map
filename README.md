# Final Project: Arbor Hill Hazard Map
Hazard site data was extracted from the [New York Department of Environmental Conservation Environmental Site Remediation Database](https://www.dec.ny.gov/cfmx/extapps/derexternal/index.cfm?pageid=3).
Street and rail data was extracted from the [USGS National Transportation Dataset for New York](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-national-transportation-dataset-ntd-for-new-york-20180117-state-or-territory-shapefile).
Stream and waterbody data was extracted from the [USGS National Map Small-Scale Collection](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/national-geospatial-program/small-scale-data).
The Arbor Hill shapefile was created by me, having consulted with the Arbor Hill Development Corporation.
