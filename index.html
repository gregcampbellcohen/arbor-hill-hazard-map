		<h2>Authored by Greg Campbell-Cohen for New Maps Plus, June 2020.</h2>
		<p>CRS: NAD 1983 StatePlane New York Central FIPS 3102 Feet (ESRI: 102716).</p>
		<p>Hazard site data was extracted from the <a href="https://www.dec.ny.gov/cfmx/extapps/derexternal/index.cfm?pageid=3">New York Department of Environmental Conservation Environmental Site Remediation Database</a>.</p>
		<p>Street and rail data was extracted from the <a href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-national-transportation-dataset-ntd-for-new-york-20180117-state-or-territory-shapefile">USGS National Transportation Dataset for New York</a>.</p>

		<h2>Hazard Information</h2>
		<p><b>Amos at Quackenbush</b> <i>(Corner of Broadway and Spencer St.)</i> This former car repair shop released toxic chemicals into the soil through floor drains, car repair operations, gasoline runoff, and oil spills. Solvents and heavy metals were present in soil, and some of the worst soil was removed. It appears PCE, a chemical that can harm brain function, may still be entering the air from the soil, but as the site is vacant, there are no further cleanup plans.</p>
		<p><b>C and F Plating</b> <i>(404 North Pearl St.)</i> A chrome plating facility from the 1920s to 1985, the surface and soil at this site was found to contain cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, mercury, zinc, barium and nickel, which can cause a wide range of health problems. Work has been done on this site, but it still requires more clean-up. The site is listed as a Class "2" State Superfund toxic waste site, which “represents a significant threat to public health or the environment; action is required.”</p>
		<p><b>Central Avenue Properties</b> <i>(524-526 Central Ave.and 455 Manning Blvd)</i> used to house a car dealership and repair facility which may have caused soil contamination. The site is owned by the City, and has not been thoroughly tested. No cleanup is being conducted. The City uses it for the police department.</p>
		<p><b>Davies Office</b> <i>(40 Loudonville St.)</i> he office furniture refurbishing center at Davies Office holds a State Air Pollution permit to release chemicals used to strip and refinish furniture, including solvents like formaldehyde, xylene, and styrene, which can irritate the eyes, throat, and lungs and contribute to cancer.</p>
		<p><b>Former Loudon and Kem Cleaners</b> <i>(120 Industrial Park Rd.)</i> is a former dry-cleaning site. The soil contains perchloroethylene, which can cause dizziness, headaches, nausea, cancer, vinyl chloride, a cancer-causing chemical, and others. It is also a Class “2” Superfund toxic waste site, and work to clean it up started in 2016. </p>
		<p><b>Former Moore Wallace Facility</b> <i>Corner of Broadway and Spencer St.</i> housed a commercial printer for decades. Chemicals used in the printing industry such as ethyl acetate, methanol, 2-butanone, isopropanol, and toluene can cause lung cancer, bladder cancer, and more. However, a full assessment of the site is not available.</p>
		<p><b>NM – North Albany</b> <i>(404 North Pearl St.)</i> is a State Superfund site that previously housed a Manufactured Gas Plant. There is coal tar and purifier waste, which can cause skin, lung, bladder, kidney, and digestive tract cancer, in the soil and groundwater at this site. The site is completely fenced and is unlikely to harm anyone nearby.</p>
		<p><b>Surpass Chemical Co., Inc.</b> <i>(1254 Broadway)</i> manufactures sodium hypochlorite (bleach) from chlorine gas, which is brought in by railroad tanks. Chlorine can irritate the skin, eyes, and lungs. Surpass has permits for storing large amounts of hazardous chemicals, and must have a plan for an accident under the Emergency Planning Community Right-to-Know Act.</p>
		<p><b>Westland Hills Park Site</b> <i>(Anthony St.)</i> was deemed unsuitable for a City of Albany middle school because the soil contains high amounts of lead, which can cause anemia, weakness, kidney, and brain damage. The city has not remediated the site due to lack of funding.</p>
		<p><b>Railroads</b> run through the eastern and northern lines of the Arbor Hill community, which can impact the neighborhood’s air quality. Some train cars containing harmful chemicals are stored nearby.</p>
		<p><b>Highways</b> I-90, I-787, US Hwy 9, and major roads like State Route 85, Washington Ave., Clinton Ave. and Central Ave., bring very high levels of traffic through and around Arbor Hill, resulting in the community having some of the highest levels of diesel particulates nationally. This results in community members having worse than average respiratory health problems according to the US Environmental Protection Agency’s National Air Toxics Assessment.</p>
